    <p>Create a new full-stack mean application that is based upon the companies in the Nasdaq index of companies.  Each company has an abbreviated symbol (facebook = fb, tesla = tesla, apple = appl, etc).</p>  
<p>
The list can be downloaded here:  http://www.nasdaq.com/screening/company-list.aspx
"Symbol","Name","LastSale","MarketCap","IPOyear","Sector","industry","Summary Quote",
"ZNGA","Zynga Inc.","3.705","$3.19B","2011","Technology","EDP Services","http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/znga",
</p>

you app should allow a user to
<ol>
    <li>
A. enter an abbreviated stock symbol,
</li>
<li>B. return the most recently traded (live) stock price (last sale). This could be based upon a api or (less desirably, a data scrape), and
</li>
<li>C. the market cap.
</li>
<li>Your app should store query results in a database.  
</li>
<li>As a bonus (ONLY AFTER you complete the first 3 things), your app could:
</li>
<li>D. have a sidebar that lists all previous queries by anyone, with the date and time and results.
</li>
<li>E. return a news story title along with a link to that story.
</li>
</ol>
